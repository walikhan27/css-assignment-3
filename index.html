    <p class="fifth">Hi, I’m Wali! I’m new to programming and have just started my journey by learning HTML. I’m excited about
        becoming a software engineer and am eager to expand my skills further by diving into CSS and JavaScript next. I
        find coding fascinating because it empowers me to create and solve problems. I’m particularly interested in
        full-stack development and look forward to mastering both front-end and back-end technologies. I believe in the
        power of collaboration and enjoy engaging with others in the coding community. Outside of coding, I love playing
        cricket, listening to music, and writing poetry. These hobbies inspire my creativity and help me recharge. I’m
        excited to see where my programming journey will take me</p>
